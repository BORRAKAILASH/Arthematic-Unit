# Arthematic-Unit
Basic Arithmetic unit is to design  a 4-bit unit which performs arithmetic operations such as addition, subraction, multiplication and division.
Objectives:
1)Design a 4-bit ar6thimetic unit that can perform arithmetic operation such as addition,subraction,multiplication and division.
2)Implement control signals to select the required condition and the unit is efficent in terms of speed and logic gates.
components:
1)4-bit adder/subractor which can be implemented using combinational full adder for addition. and 2's complemnt method for subraction.
2)
